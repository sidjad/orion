Project : The Project Orion mainly focus on Offensive part in Information security area in 1st Phase.
          Project goal is to gain maximum information about target/s and process in such way that it would helpful for further offensive operation. The goal not end here but in 2nd and 3rd phase of project it would adhere the Blue teams and Purple team too. Core of this project would be Finding, Proccessing and Optimizing the 360 degree Security measures for best practices. 


Phase   : In 1st phase we will need to develop and test the Information gathering module which is the backbone of this
          project. 
            Phase one Module one :      Contain Active,Passive,OSINT,Asset Finding modules.
                                        In each mmodule it will find various types of information,data which required further operations.
                                        Simultaniously all above modules give the instant surface level information to Pentester, Reasearcher, Network & System ops team where teams check and verify weather any unwanted things go wrong or not. 

            Phase one Module two :      The Information provided by Module one need to process and parse to this module 
                                        to dig
                                        more advance and critical information such as services, dead subdmoain, misconfigurations etc. 

                                        The module itself initiate the surface level attack vector to find low hanging fruits
                                        An uses of this module more focus for the Pentester, Reasearcher, Red teamer to further investigation.

            Phase one Module Three :    This Module more focus on collected Information proccesing and prepare for best
                                        possible Attack. 

                                        Future Operation :    Process Inforation used for the Mitre, OWASP top 10, Burp suite and many more Framwork. To create Attack scenarios, Better signature detection and SOC operations.


Phase one module one :      The module contains the several network and application enumeration based tool which help to
                            gather information 

                            Tools:- Nmap,DNSenum,ASN,Amass,subenum,Testssl,httpx,httprobe,rustscan,Dnsvalidator,Dnsrecon
