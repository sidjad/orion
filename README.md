** VISION
The Project Orion is all about automating the Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration tasks by optimising resources and improve productivity by adhering manual security testing. This will help save valuable time and resources. To achieve clear accountability and easy compliance as a result, you get improved operational efficiency. To enhance employee productivity and improving the quality of the security assessment performed on all the platforms.


** PHASE

Assign the scope
Reconnaissance & Enumeration, OSINT
Active & Passive Scanning
Service and Version info gathering 
Subdomains Enumeration & Takeover
Vulnerability Assessment  
Asset finding, Code review, Git review
Fuzzing
Pattern based attacks
Maintaining the observation and Reporting 

** FEATURES AND HIGLIGHTS


Perform complete information gathering from all the publicly available sources both actively and passively. 
Gathering critical organization's data using OSINT framework. 
Enumerating sub-domains to increase attack-surface. 
Service scanning to understand the frameworks and the services used by the application.
Port scanning.
Automated vulnerability assessment from all the information gathered.

** GOAL

The vital reason behind creating Project Orion is to provide agile results of the security findings and will help provide a streamlined workflow, better security observations and should help eliminate false-positive findings which are faced often.

Project Orion will also assist to create a database of all the security observations providing a useful reference point for any security-based operations which will be conducted in near future for example Red Teaming, Compliance and Security Hardening.

When combined with threat intelligence, security automation and its orchestration makes it possible to further enhance and automate processes, prioritize critical events, shorten response times, and make better security decisions. Because security functions are streamlined and more productive, teams will have the time to proactively search for threats rather than reacting to them and playing catch-up.
